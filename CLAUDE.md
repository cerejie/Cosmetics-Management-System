# Cosmetics Management System

Inventory and sales management for a cosmetics retail business.

## Stack

- **Package manager:** yarn (classic, 1.x) — never npm or pnpm
- **Build:** Vite + React 18 + TypeScript (strict, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`)
- **UI:** Ant Design 5 — use antd components rather than raw `div`s
- **Styling:** vanilla-extract (`*.css.ts`) for layout and bespoke styles
- **State:** zustand — do not use `useState`
- **Validation:** zod, bridged into antd forms via `utils/common/formRules.ts`
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + auth + RLS)

## Architecture — hybrid type-based

Top level is organised by technical type. Inside each, by business module
(`common`, `auth`, `inventory`, `sales`, `purchasing`, `dashboard`, `reports`,
`settings`). Inside module folders, by category (`forms`, `tables`, `modals`,
`cards`, `charts`, `inputs`, …).

```
src/
  api/        Thin Supabase wrappers. Return raw DB rows. Throw ApiError.
  services/   Map rows to domain types, orchestrate. Called only by stores.
  store/      zustand. Holds server data AND UI state (modals, filters).
  hooks/      Bind stores to components; derive values with useMemo.
  components/ Presentational + container components, grouped by module/category.
  pages/      Route-level screens. Compose components, trigger loads on mount.
  schemas/    zod schemas — the single source of truth for form validation.
  types/      Domain types + `toX()` row→domain mappers.
  utils/      Pure functions (formatting, filtering, metrics).
  routes/     Route table and guards.
  config/     env, constants, route paths.
  styles/     vanilla-extract theme + antd theme (keep the two in sync).
```

**Layering rule:** `pages → hooks/components → store → services → api → supabase`.
Never skip a layer; components must not import from `api/`.

## Conventions

- No `any`. Prefer `unknown` and `readonly`.
- Domain types are camelCase; DB row types keep snake_case and end in `Row`.
- UI state lives in the module's store, not in components.
- Mutations go through `useAsyncAction()` so toasts stay consistent.
- New forms: define a zod schema in `schemas/`, then `zodRules(schema.shape)`.
- Mobile numbers and TINs are captured with `MobileNumberInput` /
  `TinInput`, never a bare `Input`. They mask as you type and store one shape
  — `+63 917 123 4567` and `000-000-000-000` — so invoices print the value
  straight out of the database. Validate with `schemas/common/contact.schema`.
- A form's `onFinish` argument only carries fields that have a `Form.Item`.
  Values that live in `initialValues` alone are **not** in it — parse
  `form.getFieldsValue(true)` instead, or the schema will reject them as
  missing and the submit will silently do nothing.

## Printing

Printed documents are built as a standalone HTML string and rendered in a
hidden iframe (`utils/common/print.ts`), never with `window.print()` — that
would print the whole application, and taming it with `@media print` would put
knowledge of every screen into the app's stylesheet.

`types/common/invoice.types.ts` defines one `InvoiceDocument` shape; sales,
purchases and supplier statements each have a pure builder that produces one,
and `utils/common/invoiceHtml.ts` is the only renderer. Add a document by
writing a builder, not a second renderer. Reports print through
`utils/reports/reportPrint.ts`, which takes pre-formatted strings.

Every printed page carries the store profile as its letterhead, so any screen
that prints calls `useStoreProfileStore().ensureProfile()` on mount.

## Reports

`Daily | Weekly | Monthly | Annually | Date range` — the named periods all mean
the current one (today, this week, this month, this year). The range picks the
bucket automatically (`bucketFor`): day up to a month, week up to four months,
month beyond that, so no report is 365 unreadable rows.

`reportStore` owns the period and fetches sales and movements together for it.
Both report screens and Sales Analytics share it, so switching between them
never silently changes the period being measured.

## Purchasing

Kept as small as the paperwork allows — the admin using it is not a systems
person. A purchase is supplier + date + rows of (product, quantity, unit cost,
discount); saving it puts the goods into inventory straight away.

There is still no approval and no partial receiving. **There is no tax**: costs
are recorded exactly as the supplier bills them, and no screen computes VAT.
Do not reintroduce any of the three.

A purchase also carries the supplier's own paperwork — their invoice number, a
reference (delivery receipt) number, the payment method and the payment terms.
The terms are a **snapshot** copied from the supplier at save time, for the same
reason a sale snapshots its customer: correcting a supplier's standing terms
must never change an invoice that is already printed. The supplier's invoice
number is unique per supplier, so the same delivery cannot be entered twice.
Every one of those fields is optional — a delivery often arrives before its
paperwork, and refusing the stock until it turns up would be worse.

Discounts are entered per line and on the order as a whole, each as either a
peso amount or a percentage. The client sends only the type and the value;
`create_purchase` derives every peso figure and clamps a discount to what it
comes off, so a total can never go negative. `purchase_discount_amount` is the
one place that arithmetic lives, and `utils/purchasing/purchaseTotals.ts`
mirrors it for the on-screen preview — keep the two in step.

A line's `line_total` is net of its own discount, so the lines still sum to
`subtotal`; the order discount is applied once on top. For costing only, the
order discount is spread across the lines in proportion to their value, so the
weighted-average `cost_price` reflects what was actually paid.

**Drafts are local.** The purchase being typed is persisted to local storage by
`purchaseStore`, so a reload mid-delivery loses nothing, and "Save as draft"
only stamps `draftSavedAt`. Nothing is uploaded: a draft has no effect on stock
and belongs to the person typing it. Do not add a draft row to `purchases` — a
`status` column would put a filter on every history query, report and supplier
statement.

Products are created **only** from the purchase screen (the picker's "Add a new
product"), so a delivery can contain something not yet on file. The Products
page has no New Product button; it edits and removes only.

Returns are standalone: supplier + product + quantity + reason, not linked to a
past purchase order.

Suppliers carry TIN and payment terms because a purchase invoice is addressed
to them. Their statement covers a period, chosen in a dialog before printing;
it opens on the current month unless the supplier has nothing this month, in
which case it widens to their whole history.

## Customers

There is a customers table, but nobody has to maintain it. `create_sale` finds
or creates a customer from the name it is given and links the sale, so the list
fills itself from ordinary selling. Rows created that way have only a name and
show as **"no information yet"** until someone fills them in. A sale with no
name is a walk-in and links to nothing.

The sale keeps its **own copy** of the name, contact number and TIN. Renaming
or correcting a customer must never change an invoice that is already printed,
so those columns are a snapshot, not a lookup.

Details typed at the till fill blanks on the customer record but never
overwrite anything already curated on the Customers screen.

## Authentication — hybrid Supabase Auth + custom JWT

Supabase's free tier caps monthly active Auth users, so **only the superadmin
has an `auth.users` row**. Everyone else is a row in `public.users` and signs in
through the `login` RPC, which verifies a bcrypt hash and mints a JWT signed
with the project's own JWT secret. PostgREST validates that token like a native
session, so RLS is the only authorisation layer.

- One login field. Usernames cannot contain `@` (zod regex + a CHECK
  constraint), so an identifier containing `@` is the superadmin's email and
  anything else is a username. Never add tabs or an account-type selector.
- The custom token rides on a `fetch` wrapper in `api/common/supabaseClient.ts`.
  It must **never** go through `auth.setSession()` — supabase-js would try to
  refresh a token it did not issue and clobber the superadmin's session.
- Custom sessions last a hard 8 hours with no refresh. The wrapper force-logs-out
  on any 401.
- Only `{ kind, user, token }` is persisted; the superadmin's session belongs to
  supabase-js.
- Identity comes from `app.user_id()` / `app.user_role()`, never `auth.uid()` —
  custom users have no `auth.uid()`.

## Database

Migrations live in `supabase/migrations/`. Apply them in order (`0001` … `0007`)
to a new project, then optionally `seed.sql`. **Migration 0004 is not complete
without its manual steps** — setting `app.settings.jwt_secret` and disabling
Auth sign-ups; they are listed at the bottom of that file.

The `app` schema holds the JWT secret and the signing helpers. It is not exposed
via PostgREST and gets no grants beyond `execute` on the identity helpers, which
RLS policies need. Nothing else may be granted there.

**Security invariants — do not weaken these:**

- Stock is only ever changed by the `create_purchase`, `create_sale`,
  `void_sale`, and `create_purchase_return` RPCs. They lock rows (`for update`)
  so concurrent sales cannot oversell. Direct `insert`/`update` on `products` is
  revoked from `authenticated` — never write `stock_quantity` from the client.
- **Inventory increases only by saving a purchase.** It decreases only by a sale
  or a return to the supplier. `save_product` has no stock argument and
  `adjust_stock` is revoked from `authenticated` (migration 0005); the product
  screen is a catalogue. Do not add an "add stock" path to it.
- Every stock change writes a `stock_movements` row. The audit trail must stay
  complete. This is why **products are never hard-deleted once they have
  history**: `delete_product` (migration 0006) archives a product that appears
  in a sale, purchase, return or movement and only truly deletes an unused one.
  Direct `delete` on `products` is revoked, so that RPC is the only path.
- A movement's "on hand before" is derived (`quantity_after - quantity`), never
  stored. Reports read opening and closing levels from the log itself, so a
  report of a past period stays correct however much has happened since.
- `create_sale` reads prices from the database; `create_purchase` recomputes
  every line total *and both discounts*, and `create_purchase_return` reads the
  cost from the product. The client sends only quantities, unit costs, how each
  discount is expressed, and customer identity — never a peso total it worked
  out itself.
- `users.role` is not settable by the user. `register` always creates a *pending
  employee* and never reads a role from its arguments; changes go through
  `set_user_role`. Column grants (`grant update (full_name)`) enforce this,
  because RLS cannot restrict columns.
- Password hashes live in `app.user_credentials`, never on `public.users`.
  `users_select` is `using (true)`, so a hash column there would be readable by
  every employee.
- Who may create, approve, or reset whom is decided **inside** the RPCs. The
  `useAuth()` / `canManageRole()` checks only hide buttons.
- Every `SECURITY DEFINER` function pins `set search_path`.
- `login` returns one message for every failure, so it cannot enumerate
  usernames, and refuses pending, rejected, and inactive accounts.
- Client-side guards are UX only; the database enforces the same rules.

### Roles

Hierarchical — each role may only manage the roles strictly below it.

| Role | Lives in | Signs in with | Can do |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `superadmin` | `auth.users` + a `public.users` row | email | everything; creates admins and employees |
| `admin` | `public.users` | username | creates employees; approves requests; full inventory; voids sales |
| `employee` | `public.users` | username | records sales; reads inventory |

There is exactly one superadmin, seeded by signing up once in the Supabase
dashboard. It keeps a `public.users` row purely so `sales.created_by` and
`stock_movements.created_by` resolve — authorisation is still derived from the
token (`app.is_superadmin()` = authenticated but not a custom user).

Accounts arrive two ways: `admin_create_user` (already approved) or `register`
(self-service, `pending` until an admin approves it on the Users page).

`is_admin()` means *admin or superadmin* and gates inventory management.
`can_manage_role(target)` gates user management. Both read the token only, so
they are safe to call from a policy.

### Known limitation

Tokens stay valid for their full 8 hours: disabling or demoting a user does not
take effect until their token expires. Add a `token_version` column and claim if
immediate revocation becomes a requirement.
